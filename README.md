> An exploration into creating a truly personal, powerful, and private AI assistant, inspired by systems like Iron Man's Jarvis. Archon is designed to run entirely locally, putting you in complete command of your data and your digital world. This project prioritizes offline functionality, modularity, and user sovereignty above all.

## About The Project

Project Archon is an ambitious challenge to build a sophisticated, voice-controlled AI assistant that operates completely offline. In a world of cloud-based services, Archon takes a different path: privacy and self-reliance. By leveraging local Speech-to-Text (STT) and Large Language Models (LLM), it aims to provide powerful AI capabilities without ever sending your data to a third-party server.

This project is for tinkerers, developers, and privacy advocates who believe in the power of local computing and dream of having their own Jarvis-like system to manage their digital environment.

## Key Features

* **Sovereign & Offline-First:** All core processes run on your local machine. No internet connection is required for its primary functions.
* **Privacy by Design:** Your voice, your commands, and your data never leave your computer.
* **Voice-Powered:** Designed from the ground up for a hands-free, natural language interface.
* **Modular & Extensible:** The architecture is being built to easily allow for new "skills" and commands to be added.
* **Locally Processed AI:** Intended to use local engines for both understanding speech and generating responses.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Project-Archon.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Project-Archon.git)
    ```
    *(Jangan lupa ganti `YourUsername` dengan nama pengguna GitHub Anda)*

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Project-Archon
    ```

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    * On Windows:
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies (currently none, but will be used later):**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

The project is currently in its initial phase (text-based logic framework). To run the assistant:

```sh
python asisten_offline.py
